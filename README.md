# ARP Cache Poisoner with Scapy
An awesome python tool for learning about ARP cache poisoning using scapy module.

## Description

This Python script demonstrates **ARP cache poisoning** using the `scapy` library. It can intercept traffic between a target machine and the gateway by sending forged ARP responses to both, effectively placing the attacker in a **Man-in-the-Middle (MITM)** position.

---

## Features

- Retrieves MAC addresses of gateway and target.
- Sends continuous spoofed ARP responses.
- Restores ARP tables on exit.
- Sniffs and saves network packets using `scapy`.

---

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- [Scapy](https://scapy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)
- Root privileges (`sudo`)
- Linux-based OS (Tested on Kali Linux)

Install dependencies:
``bash \n
sudo apt install python3-pip \n
pip3 install scapy``


## Usage
  1. Edit the Script:
     - Change interface, target_ip, and gateway_ip as per your setup.

  2. Run the Script with Sudo:
     - sudo python3 arp_poisoner.py
  3. Stop Execution:
     - Press CTRL+C to stop the attack. The script will automatically restore ARP tables.

## Sample Configuration
  ``interface = 'eth0' \n
  target_ip = '192.168.1.180' \n
  gateway_ip = '192.168.1.1'``

## Output
  Captured packets will be saved to a .pcap file named _arper.pcap_. You can open it with Wireshark or similar tools.
